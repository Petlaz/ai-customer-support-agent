# Build Log

Concise record of what worked, what did not work, and key decisions per phase.

---

## Phase 0 — Environment & Dependencies [DONE]
**2026-06-21**

**What worked:**
- Python 3.11.13 venv, 33 packages installed, `.env` configured
- Langfuse connection verified (US region: `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com`)
- All imports from `config/settings.py` and `config/constants.py` pass

**What did not work:**
- OpenAI API calls — key set but no billing credits (429 quota error)
- Anthropic API calls — key set but no billing credits (400 insufficient_quota)

**Decisions / Notes:**
- WARNING: OpenAI key accidentally written into `.env.example` — caught, reverted with `git restore`, keys rotated
- Langfuse must use US region endpoint, not the default EU one

---

## Phase 3b — Core Data Models [DONE]
**2026-06-22**

**What worked:**
- All 6 Pydantic schemas in `api/schemas/` import cleanly
- `AgentState` TypedDict in `agents/state.py` imports cleanly
- SQLAlchemy engine connects to SQLite at `data/support_agent.db`
- Alembic migration `74ea40ee529d` generated and applied — 8 tables confirmed

**What did not work:**
- Nothing failed in this phase

**Decisions / Notes:**
- Alembic `env.py` reads `DATABASE_URL` from `config/settings.py` at runtime — no hardcoded URLs in config files
- All models must be imported in `alembic/env.py` for autogenerate to detect them
- Inserted Phase 3b — original checklist placed database models at Phase 11, which would have broken the Memory Layer (Phase 6)

---

## Phase 4 — Sample Data [DONE]
**2026-06-23**

**What worked:**
- 4 policy documents written with realistic content (Nexus Software — fictional SaaS)
- 18 sample tickets covering all 6 categories validated
- 3 customer histories and 6 historical resolutions with full agent responses written
- 10 eval cases validated — 3 designed to force escalation (>$500 refund, GDPR, fraud keywords)
- All JSON files parse without errors: 18 + 3 + 6 + 10 records

**What did not work:**
- Nothing failed in this phase

**Decisions / Notes:**
- `technical_support_guide.md` was missing from the checklist but referenced in `config/constants.py` — added and ticked
- Escalation triggers in eval cases: EVAL-006 (high-value refund), EVAL-007 (GDPR Article 17), EVAL-008 (fraud + lawyer keywords)

## Blocking Issues

| Issue | Impact | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| OpenAI no billing credits | BLOCKING Phase 5 (embeddings) | Add credits at `platform.openai.com/settings/billing` |
| Anthropic no billing credits | Non-blocking | Only needed if switching `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic` |

## Upcoming

| Phase | Goal | Needs OpenAI? |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Phase 5 | RAG pipeline — load, chunk, embed, store, retrieve | Yes |
| Phase 6 | Memory layer — short-term, long-term, semantic | No |
| Phase 7 | LangGraph agent graph | Yes |
| Phase 8 | Agent tools | Yes |
